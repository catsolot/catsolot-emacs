This is a custom configuration for emacs that makes use of chemacs2. Make sure you have an installation of chemacs2 already installed before you use this configuration. Clone this repository to $HOME/.config/catsolot-emacs. Running install.sh will create the two required symbolic links to interface with chemacs2. emacs-profile is used to determine which profile will be run when emacs is run without any options.
